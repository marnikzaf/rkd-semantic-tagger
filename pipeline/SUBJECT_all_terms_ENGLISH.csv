The style differs from Belgian and French Art Nouveau by a more restrained use of decoration.

"Refers to a painting style and art theory identified with a group of French artists between 1886 and 1906. The term was coined by the art critic Félix Fénéon in a review of the eighth and last Impressionist exhibition (1886), in which Camille Pissarro, Lucien Pissaro, Paul Signac and Georges Seurat exhibited their work in one room, asserting a shared vision. Other artists who practiced the style were Charles Angrand, Louis Hayet, Henri Edmond Cross, Léo Gausson, Hippolyte Petitjean, Albert Dubois, and Maximilien Luce. Seurat is considered the outstanding artist of the movement. Neo-Impressionism both developed out of Impressionism and was a reaction against it. Like Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism was concerned with light and color but while the former was typically spontaneous and empirical, the later was based more on scientific principles and resulted in formalized compositions. The associated technique is referred to as pointillism and the associated theory is referred to as divisionism, although the two terms are often used interchangably and are also both used to refer to the style and movement. While relatively short-lived, the movement had a large impact on other artists and movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
","Neo-Impressionism","3063"
"An informal group of painters that was centered in the village of Barbizon around the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau. Influenced by John Constable and 17th century Dutch landscape painters, the Barbizon painters were concerned with depicting naturalistic settings and the dignity of peasant life. Theodore Rousseau, the unofficial leader of the School, moved to the Fontainebleau region in 1841 and began acquiring disciples, such as Jean-Francois Millet, who would later become the most renown member of the Barbizon School, and whose work had more overt socialist overtones. Because of their non-traditional approach to subject matter, it took until the 1850's for the individual members of the School to become critically accepted. Rousseau, in fact, had been rejected by the Salons so often he garnered the nickname 'le grande refuse'. After several decades of success, the movement lost popularity with Millet's death in 1875. Though often seen as a transitional movement between classical landscape painting and Impressionism, the Barbizon School's importance lies with their plein-air landscape technique and humble, unpretentious subject matter.","Barbizon School","3103"

"Schildertechniek waarbij tinten en kleurschakeringen ontstaan door het regelmatig aanbrengen van kleine stippen ongemengd pigment op het canvas, zodat ze voor het oog in elkaar overvloeien. De term ‘pointillisme’ verwijst alleen naar de techniek, terwijl ‘neo-impressionisme’ verwijst naar zowel de door Georges Seurat ontwikkelde stijl als de daaruit voortkomende beweging die tussen 1886 en 1906 zijn bloeiperiode had. Seurat zelf gaf de voorkeur aan de term 'chromo-luminarism', waaruit blijkt dat hij zowel licht- als kleureffecten wilde intensiveren. De Franse criticus Félix Fénéon bedacht de term 'peinture au point' in 1886 na het zien van Seurat's 'La Grande Jatte'. Paul Signac stelde de alternatieve term 'divisionisme' voor in zijn boek 'D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-Impressionnisme' (1899).","pointillism (painting technique)","3252"

It is characterized by a renewed interest in medieval piety, an expressive use of nature, the relationship of the human figure and events to nature, and the introduction of landscape as a primary theme in art. The term was coined by Theodor von Frimmel (1853-1928), who believed that painting in the Danube River region around Regensburg, Passau, and Linz possessed common characteristics; the style seems to exist even though leading artists did not form a school in the usual sense of the term, since they did not work in a single workshop or in a particular center.

With specific reference to the visual arts, the term is used to describe an abstract art movement and style, predominantly of sculpture, that flourished in the mid- and late 1960s. With specific reference to music, it refers to a style that emerged in the United States in the 1960s featuring prolonged repetition of short passages and unvarying harmonies.","minimal art","23594"

"Style of painting that was primarily employed by a loosely associated group of late 19th-century Italian artists seeking a distinctly Italian avant-garde style. It uses hatching, dashes, or patches of colors to visually achieve a luminous optical effect, rather than physically mixing colors of paint. At close viewing, a Divisionist canvas is a mass of contrasting marks; at a distance, the colors are intended to visually enhance each other and produce an effect of shimmering luminosity. The style that specifically uses dots of color is usually called ""Pointillist"" in modern usage. While French painters using this or a similar style may be called ""Neo-Impressionist,"" for Italian painters, it is common to call them ""Divisionist."" The Italian artists' style was considered both autonomous from their other European counterparts and pioneering of Modernism.","Divisionism","23694"

The term can also refer more broadly to any crystallized carbonate rock, including true marble and certain types of limestone, that will take a polish and can be used for architectural and ornamental purposes.","marble","37445"
"A hard, strong construction material comprising a mixture of sand, gravel, crushed rock, or other aggregate, held together, typically by a hardened paste of cement and/or lime. Several types of aggregate are used such as crushed stone, slag, cinders or gravel. Ancient Romans developed pozzolan cement about the 3rd century BCE. Modern concretes use various cements such as portland or hydraulic. Concrete is durable and relatively inexpensive, used for foundations, bridges, dams, walls, and highways. Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension so it is often reinforced with steel bars or wire netting. Once a concrete mixture is stirred with water and poured into a mold, it is allowed to cure slowly over about a week. Stresses, such as vibration, freezing, and rapid drying, will diminish the strength and durability of the concrete. As it ages, concrete is subject to erosion, spalling, and pollution. Poor mixing can cause erosion. Spalling can be due to freeze-thaw cycles of moisture and ice, salt crystallization, or corrosion of steel reinforcements. Acid rain can deplete the natural alkaline reserve of fresh concrete.","concrete","37446"

Bronze was made before 3,000 BCE -- possibly as early as 10,000 BCE, although its common use in tools and decorative items is dated only in later artifacts. The proportions of copper and tin vary widely, from 70 to 95 percent copper in surviving ancient artifacts. Because of the copper base, bronze may be very malleable and easy to work. By the Middle Ages in Europe, it was recognized that using the metals in certain proportions could yield specific properties. Some modern bronzes contain no tin at all, substituting other metals such as aluminum, manganese, and even zinc. Historically, the term was used interchangeably with ""latten."" U.S. standard bronze is composed of 90% copper, 7% tin and 3% zinc. Ancient bronze alloys sometimes contained up to 14% tin.""","bronze","37460"

"Pure metallic element having symbol Ag and atomic number 47; a malleable, ductile, white metal with characteristic sheen, considered a precious metal. Silver is widely distributed throughout the world, occurring rarely as metallic silver (in Peru, Norway) but more often as silver-gold alloys and silver ore. Today silver is obtained as a byproduct in the refinement of gold, lead, copper, or zinc ores. Silver was smelted from the ore galena as early as 3800 BCE. As a pure metal, silver is second to gold in malleability and ductility, can be polished to a highly reflective surface, and used -- typically in an alloy -- in jewelry, coinage, photography, mirrors, electrical contacts, and tableware.","silver","37471"

"Pure metallic element having the symbol Cu and atomic number 29; a reddish brown, ductile metal that is present in the earth's crust, occurring as a native metal and as ores of sulfide, sulfate and carbonate (azurite, malachite, etc.). It was the first metal used by humans, probably from about 8000 BCE, in the regions of Mesopotamia and India. By about 3800 BCE copper was made into bronze for weapons and knives. Today, copper is one of the most widely used metals because it has high electrical and thermal conductivity, can be easily fabricated, is ductile and polishes well. In moist air, copper forms a protective green film of basic carbonate. Metallic copper combines well with other metals to form alloys, most commonly brass and bronze. Copper and its alloys are used for wire, electrical devices, pipes, cooking vessels, ammunition, ornamental trim, roofing, grillwork, coins, musical instruments, jewelry, and sculptures.","copper","43430"

For Christians, a canon of biblical books was established in the Early Christian period; however, several apocryphal books continued to circulate long afterwards.

"A Christian religious order following the rule of St. Benedict of Nursia (ca. 480-547). St. Benedict's rule is a detailed guide for the government and spiritual and material welfare of a monastery. By the 7th century the rule was also being applied to women and by the early 9th century it had supplanted most other monastic styles in northern and western Europe. Benedictines hold to the well-rounded daily routine of prayer, manual labor, and study prescribed by St. Benedict. Stability, group prayer, and obedience to the abbot are emphasized. The order, which is composed of autonomous monasteries, has a long tradition of scholarship and teaching.","Benedictine","63458"
"A Roman Catholic order founded by the Spanish St. Dominic in 1215 in southern France. The novelties of the new order were the obligation to pursue theological study and the mission to preach doctrine, a task previously regarded as the prerogative of bishops and their delegates alone. This mendicant order features a centralized government and organization and emphasizes missionary work and scholarship, thereby combining an active and a contemplative life. A member belongs to the order, not to any one autonomous house, and can be sent anywhere at any time. Famous Dominican scholars include Albertus Magnus and his pupil St. Thomas Aquinas. The system Aquinas developed was offically adopted by the order in 1278. There is an order of Dominican nuns that grew tremendously in the 19th and 20th centuries as well as a tertiary order of members not enclosed in a monastery. The order is noted for its continued orthodox following of Aquinas' teachings.","Dominican","63459"
"Broad term for a Roman Catholic religious order comprising several divisions; founded by St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226). The rule emphasizes the vow of poverty, theology, preaching, and aid to the poor and sick. Different schools of thought among followers developed over the years; St. Bonaventure (1257-1274) founded a moderate interpretation of St. Francis' rule that bridged many of the differences. The independent branches of the order are the First Order of Franciscans: the Observants, the Conventuals, and the Capuchins; the Second Order comprises nuns established by St. Clare under the guidance of St. Francis, known as the Poor Clares; and the Third Order comprising religious and lay men and women, including the Third Order Secular (living in the world without vows) and Third Order Regular (living in religious communities under vow).","Franciscan","63460"
"A Roman Catholic order for men founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius of Loyola, a Spanish soldier who experienced a religious conversion while convalescing from a battle wound. It is a non-contemplative order requiring strict obedience, compliance with Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises, and special loyalty to the pope. The Jesuits abandoned many medieval practices including obligatory regular penances or fasts; a common dress; and the choral recitation of the liturgical office. Other innovations include their very centralized form of authority with life tenure for the head of the order; gradation of members; a probationary period of many years before final vows; and lack of a female branch. Jesuits carry out many kinds of missionary work with special emphasis on education; the order has founded many colleges and universities throughout the world. The Jesuits have been leading apologists for the Roman Catholic Church, particularly during the Counter-Reformation. In more recent times, the order has been highly influential in modernizing the Church.","Jesuit","63461"
"Un orden religiosa católica romana que originó en el siglo XII de los ermitaños del Monte Carmelo quienes buscaban el estilo de vida del profeta Eliahu. Cuando las Cruzadas fracasaron, los Carmelitas emigraron a Europa donde proliferaron como frailes mendicantes. Se practican estrictamente soledad, abstinencia, y oración. En 1452 los frailes se unieron con monjas Carmelitas (Hermanas de la Bendita Virgen María del Monte Carmelo), la Segunda Orden Carmelita.

"Refers to books or other document forms containing the Book of Psalms, which is composed of 150 psalms of the Old Testament. A psalter is usually divided into sections to be recited daily at Matins and Sunday Vespers, used as a liturgical book for the clergy in the Divine Office (forming the basis for the Breviary) or by the laity for private devotions. In addition to the psalms, psalters generally contain an ecclesiastical calendar, canticles, creeds, and the litany of the saints. King David and his court musicians were traditionally considered to be the authors of the psalms; the subjects of the psalms have to do with hymns in praise of God and pleas for help and mercy. In the Christian tradition, the psalms were interpreted with the Lord of the Old Testament understood to be Christ the Messiah. Various passages of individual psalms were seen as Christian metaphors and prefigurations. The Hebrew text of the psalms reached the Latin West by way of translations made by St. Jerome in the 4th century AD, two from the Greek version (the Septuagint) and one directly from the original language. The three versions, known respectively as the Roman, Gallican, and Hebrew Psalters. The psalter was one of the most frequently illustrated medieval texts in the West, beginning around 725 and flourishing between the 12th and 14th centuries. The text was often enhanced with precious ornament and images; however, psalms did not readily lend themselves to literal illustration, in contrast to the narrative portions of the bible. Consequently, their illustration was varied, both in format and in iconography. Most illuminated psalters were illustrated with decorated or historiated initials at the main divisions of the text.","psalter (book)","64279"

"Refers to the principal festival and feast of the Christian church in which the resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. In Western churches it is observed between March 22 and April 25 depending on the date of the first full moon after the vernal equinox. Orthodox churches use the Julian date for the equinox and so usually celebrate Easter on a different, later date. The name may derive from 'Eostre,' the name of an Anglo-Saxon spring goddess. Some traditions associated with Easter (e.g. Easter eggs, the Easter rabbit) have pagan origins. Easter evolved from the primitive Christian feast known as the Pasch of the 2nd and 3rd centuries; it was the Christian counterpart to the Jewish festival of Passover and it commemorated both Christ's death and Christ's resurrection. The paschal vigil is the main celebration of Easter in liturgical churches and is held on the night before; the paschal candle was introduced in about the 4th century. While the festival of Easter occurs on one particular Sunday, its importance is emphasized by the long preparation of Lent, by the solemn services of Holy Week, and by the following fifty days until Pentecost, a period known as Eastertide or Paschaltide. Easter's importance is reflected in the fact that the entire liturgical year of worship is arranged around it, as is the ecclesiastical calendar of movable feasts. There are many allusions to baptism in Easter services, reflecting the early practice of baptizing catechumens during the vigil.","Easter","64337"

Carnivores have in common that they possess teeth and claws adapted for catching and eating other animals. Some eat primarily or exclusively meat, while others are omnivores. Members are typically hunter and scavenger meat-eating mammals such as dogs, cats, wolves, foxes, bears, and seals. Given that the order includes such great taxonomic diversity, the characteristics used to separate Carnivora from other mammalian orders and to define the subdivisions of Carnivora are primarily structural, notably certain features of the skull (such as jaw articulation), feet (number of toes, lack of opposability of the hind toe, type of claws, and fusion of certain bones), and teeth (both the overall tooth pattern and the shape of individual teeth).

"In modern usage, a general term for case furniture of various designs, sometimes on legs, with cupboard space beneath and placed along the wall of a dining room for serving, storage, and displaying plate and other precious tableware.

By the 17th century sideboards were being designed with a cupboard or drawers beneath a flat table surface. The top was higher than a standard table, allowing the plate on display to be seen easily, as well as making the food more conveniently accessible to a standing person. Victorian sideboards often had levels or shelves above the primary surface, in order to create more space for displaying tableware. ""Dressers (cupboards)"" may be similar in design and function, but were typically found in kitchens rather than dining rooms.

"Genus of hardy, deciduous trees of the family Betulaceae, common to North America, Europe and Asia. Birch tress are readily distinguished by their white bark and diamond-shaped leaves. The lightweight bark contains natural waxes, oils, and tannins that make it tough, durable, and waterproof. Thin sheets of bark were commonly used for paper in Central Asia and the Far East. The water-impervious bark was used for wigwams, canoes, and shoes for Native Americans. Birch produces a strong, pale yellow-brown wood with a close, straight grain and uniform texture that finishes to a smooth surface. Dyes can also be obtained from various parts of birch trees. The leaves, usually gathered before they develop a mature green color, produce a yellow dye. The bark produces a pale brown color. The female catkins (a long shoot bearing flowers with no leaves) are boiled to produce a dull yellow color. Birch bark oil and birch beer are made from sap obtained from the trees. The sap allows birch bark to burn even when it is wet.","birch","65914"

"Phylum having members that are characterized by a hard, spiny covering or skin. Echinoderms have existed since the Lower Cambrian Period, and today comprise about extant 7,000 species that fall into five well-defined groups: Crinoidea (sea lilies and feather stars), Ophiuroidea (basket stars and brittle stars), Asteroidea (starfishes), Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea biscuits), and Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers). In the 19th century, Echinodermata was recognized as a distinct group of animals that was occasionally associated with the cnidarians and selected other phyla in a division of the animal kingdom known as the Radiata, however the concept of the superphylum Radiata is no longer valid. Marine invertebrate animals of radially symmetrical structure, having a body wall stiffened by calcareous pieces that may protrude as spines, and tiny hydraulically-operated tube-feet.","echinoderms (Echinodermata)","70095"

"Species of alder native to Europe, the British Isles, and Africa, and cultivated in the United States. Known as black alder for its dark bark and cones.","black alder","71263"
"Genus containing about 30 species of ornamental shrubs and trees that are primarily north temperate in distribution, but range south through the Andes to about latitude 20 degrees S. It is only in the Americas that members of the family extend along the mountains into the Southern Hemisphere. An alder may be distinguished from a birch by its usually stalked winter buds and by cones that remain on the branches after the small, winged nutlets are released. The scaly bark is grayish brown in some species and almost white in others. The oval leaves are alternate, serrate, and often shallowly lobed; sticky on unfolding but glossy when mature, they fall without changing colour. Male and female flowers are borne in separate catkins on the same tree; they form during the summer and usually blossom the following spring before the leaves open.","alder","71265"

"Genus of around 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, order Pinales, found in northern temperate and boreal. Mature trees may be 20-60 m (66-200 feet) tall. They are distinguished from similar genera by whorled branches, conical form, with needle-like leaves attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, and rough rather than smooth branches. As needles are shed throughout the life of the tree, the branches retain a rough appearance from the pulvinus, to which the needles had been attached. Comprises around 40 species of evergreen ornamental and timber trees native to the temperate and cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are pyramidal trees with whorled branches and thin, scaly bark.","spruce","71300"

"The belief system, teachings, and practices of the fraternal order of Free and Accepted Masons, the world's largest secret society. Spread by the advance of the British Empire, Freemasonry remains most popular in the British Isles and in other countries associated the empire. It is said to have been established for mutual help and fellowship; members believe that it has historical roots traceable back through the Romans to the Egyptians and the building of the pyramids. Freemasonry incorporates traditions and rituals that make symbolic use of or reference to the tools of medieval stonemasons, notably the square and compasses. In medieval Europe, like other craft organizations of the period, many medieval associations of masons whose members included freemasons, had developed elaborate secret rituals for imparting the knowledge of their craft and for the initiation of new members. These rituals continued to evolve during the early modern period. In 16th-century Scotland Freemasonry began to incorporate elements of contemporary Hermetic thought. From the early 17th century, the lodges began to admit members who were not connected with the building trades.","freemasonry","71695"

The photographs were typically portraits and the image was a standard size of 3 1/4 x 2 1/4 inches; they were generally produced by a multiple-lens camera that created several images on a single full-sized negative plate. Full-size prints from the plate were cut into sections measuring 4 x 2 1/2 inches, and the pieces were often mounted on cards, which initially served as visitors' cards; it later became the custom to exchange them on birthdays and holidays, and to collect cartes-de-visite of friends, family members, and celebrities in albums.

The window or other item is made by cutting pieces of colored glass based on a full-scale cartoon and holding the pieces together by strips of lead. Details may be painted on the surface of the pieces of glass and fired in a kiln before piecing the glass together. The method of weatherproofing and fixing the glass in a window is often highly decorative and forms an important element of the design.

"Prints created to serve as copies of a painting or drawing by another artist, particularly popular in 17th- to 19th-century Europe. The print is considered a reproductive print if the primary intention was to record artistic heritage, even if the personality of the printmaker has been asserted to a small extent. The term is usually reserved for prints that reproduce another two-dimensional art work; however, occasionally it is also used to refer to prints that portray sculpture or decorative arts, if the printmaker's primary intention was to record the original art works for a mass audience. Prints depicting architecture are not considered reproductive prints. Prints in which another art work is incidentally depicted as part of a larger subject are not reproductive prints. Reproductive prints are valued because they map the dissemination, reception, and historiography of original works. They were popular in Europe from the 17th through early 19th century, and fell out of fashion with the invention of photography.","reproductive print","74313"

"Refers to the religious ideas of individuals and groups who were greatly influenced by the reformer John Calvin (1509-64) as well as by 17th-century Calvinist scholars. Calvinism stresses the sovereignty of God over all aspects of life and the Bible as the sole rule of faith. Justification by faith alone is another central concept. Although predestination was not a leading axiom of Calvin's theology, it was heavily emphasized by his early followers, in part to distinguish themselves from followers of Luther. The Helvetic Confession (1566) and the Synod of Dort (1618-19) were important moments in the history of Calvinist theology; the latter affirming the 'five points of Calvinism': total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and the final perseverance of the saints. By the mid-17th century, Calvinism had spread from France and Holland to England and Scotland where it was espoused by the Puritans and taken to New England. While it has suffered rationalistic attacks, it influenced much church life and there has been a Neo-Calvinist renewal in modern times led by the theologian Karl Barth. As an historical force, Calvinism has had a wide impact on European and Northern American culture.","Calvinism","80719"

"A Roman Catholic order formed in 1098 by Benedictine monks and led by St. Robert of Molesme in Citeaux, France.

The order was prominent during the Middle Ages, particularly under the leadership of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153), with over 500 houses in Europe by the 13th century, but declined thereafter. The Cistercian's emphasis on manual labor, particularly farm labor, meant that the order played an important role in the economic progress of the 12th century and in the development of farming and marketing techniques. Reform movements occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries and the order ultimately divided into the Order of the Reformed Cistercians of the Strict Observance (often popularly called the Trappists) and the Cistercians of Common Observance. Today, there is a great amount of diversity among the monasteries of both orders and there has been a revival of literary work in both.

The festival also commemorates Christ's first miracle at Cana in Galilee. Gifts are exchanged on Epiphany instead of Christmas in some countries.

Voor beeldsnijwerken werd veel gebruik gemaakt van been en schildpad. Naarmate de islam zich in de 15de eeuw over Java verspreidde, werden de beeldhouwstijlen meer gekenmerkt door diep ingesneden reliëfs met een levendige maar minder verfijnde dynamiek en werden religieuze thema's als verlossing en redding afgebeeld. De bouwstijl uit deze periode kenmerkt zich door de candi, een tempelcomplex met meestal een dakstructuur die bestaat uit in lagen aangebrachte stenen, versierd met arkels, basementen met rond lijstwerk, cellae en beeldhouwwerken van banaspatikoppen. Granaten, kristallen, parels, ivoor en amethisten werden gebruikt in armbanden en halskettinghangers. De hofsieraden zijn voorzien van ingesneden iconografie.

"A Roman Catholic monastic order founded by St. Bruno of Cologne in Chartreuse (north of Grenoble, France) in 1084.

The monks or nuns live in individual cells and only come together at specific times of the day and at special feasts; strict abstinence is practiced. The Carthusians spread slowly, but, by 1521, the order numbered 195 houses in every Catholic European country. They played an important role in the monastic-reform movement of the 11th and 12th centuries; it is itself, however, the one form of communal religious life that has not experienced reform.

"Refers to the Christian feast and festival observed on December 25 to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. Its observance is first documented in Rome in 336. The practice of celebrating on December 25 began in the 4th century in the Western church as a Christian replacement for the pagan festival held on the winter solstice to celebrate the birth of the unconquered sun. The East originally gave the date of January 6 for the nativity but the date of December 25 was generally accepted by the 5th century; the Armenian Church, however, still celebrates on January 6. Christmas took on the festivity (i.e. decorations and gift-giving) of the Roman Saturnalia and other pagan festivals of that time of year. Christmas has continued to accumulate traditions over the centuries; many of the customs associated with the holiday are of non-Christian origin. Evergreens, for example, are symbols of survival and have been associated with Christmas ever since the European Middle Ages. Christmas is traditionally regarded as a festival of the family and of children. In many countries presents are exchanged in the name of or in the spirit of the holiday's patron, Saint Nicholas, or Santa Claus.","Christmas","81800"

"Refers to the style and period of art and architecture that developed in the 1960s and after, when there was a clear challenge to the dominance of Modernism. Generally speaking, it advocated a pluralistic approach to the arts and it stated that Modernism had failed because of a lack of a coded language of meaning to the viewer. The term was first used by Spanish poet Federico de Onis in 1934 and later by Arnold Toynbee's ""A Study of History"" in 1938, but it was in the 1970s when it came into wide use in connection with a trend in architecture that employed selective Eclecticism and Historicism. This resulted in structures that displayed a knowledge of Modernism, but also playful, whimsical, applications of Classical elements. In the other arts, such as painting, there was a return to a classical approach to the human figure, style, and composition, often resulting in Old Masters style works, but with updated imagery, such as the inclusion of current celebrities, or artists from the past. In photography, as well as painting, a narrative or story telling approach to work also became popular. By the early 1980s, many work dubbed Postmodern, were purchased by the corporate art market, where large sums were paid for the work of relatively new artists. By the 1990s, Postmodernism showed signs of slowing down in terms of popularity, when more traditional Modernist forms began to re-emerge.","Post-modernism","82779"

Ancient Rome became a powerful force and supplanted Greek and Etruscan influence on the Apennine peninsula. Its rule and influence gradually encompassed a wide area in Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Minor. Its influence was wide in scope, including sculpture, painting, architecture, engineering, language, the road system, law, and many other areas of culture. Roman art and architecture is characterized by early derivations from Greek art and architecture, but it gradually developed into a style of its own, absorbing characteristics of styles from the far flung regions under its control.","Roman","82923"

"Refers to the style and period associated with the reign of the Islamic dynasty that began to rule in Anatolia in 1281 until the promulgation of the Constitution of the Turkish Republic in 1924. Under the support of Ottoman sultans, a distinct architectural style developed that combined the Islamic traditions of Anatolia, Iran, and Syria with those of the Classical world and Byzantium. The result was a rationalist approach that favored spatial unity and clarity, the most important structure being the kulliye, a building complex combining religious, educational and charitable buildings. The main architectural theme of this complex was the domed square unit and combinations of varying spatial and architectonic expressions. The mosque, and in some cases the mosque-convent, was the crowning achievement. Under the conquest of Constantinople and the establishment of new administrative palaces across the empire, the relationship between Ottoman patrons and the artist became centralized. A corps of court architects employed architects of different ranks, and controlled all building activity throughout the empire. A community of craftsman brought together societies of artists and craftsman, forming the imperial design studio where illuminated manuscripts, tiles, woodwork, carved stone, jade, and metal objects, along with carpets and textiles were produced. These works typically chronicled the important events of a sultan's rule. During the 18th and 19th century, Ottoman art was increasingly westernized in style, often incorporating elements of European Baroque style.","Ottoman","84584"

"Refers to a type of European, and especially French, ornament in which monkeys dressed in human clothing mimic such activities as drinking, dancing, hunting, and playing musical instruments. The monkeys are often placed in a setting of scrolling foliage or strapwork. Although ornamental monkeys had been depicted since the Middle Ages as a means to parody and mock the baser human activities, the taste for more elegant singerie first developed in the late 17th century in the work of Jean Bérain I and Claude Audran III. Singerie decoration reached its height of popularity in the 18th century (i.e. the work of Christophe Huet) when it became associated with chinoiserie, fading from fashion with the rise of Neoclassicism. It enjoyed another wave of popularity in the 19th-century revival of 18th-century taste. Singerie developed in part as a way of lampooning the excessive fadism for neo-Chinese forms of the aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie which some artists considered pretentious. Singerie is found on porcelain, faience, and marquetry as well as embroidered and printed on textiles and painted on walls.","singerie","93009"

"A Christian denomination having both Protestant and Catholic aspects that originated with Henry VIII's break with the Roman Catholic Church (ca. 1532-34). As the official state Church of England, the monarch of England is still formally considered its head. While at first it remained mainly Catholic in character, reforms came under Edward IV and Elizabeth I who introduced doctrine that was more Protestant in nature, namely new editions of the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-nine Articles. Although an overall attitude of toleration exists in the modern Anglican Church, tension remains between its Protestant and Catholic inclinations as well as with newer liberal and evangelical influences. Anglicanism is based on episcopal authority and parish structure is fundamental to the organization of the church. The term is used with regard to the Church of England; with regard to the Episcopal Church in America, use ""Episcopal.""","Anglican","94767"

As such, the Son was not co-equal or co-eternal with the Father. According to the Arians, Jesus was created- not begotten- by God and he achieved his divinity through his perfect obedience to God. Arius' doctrine was condemned as heretical at a synod in Alexandria in 321 and definitively at the Council of Nicaea in 325. Arianism maintained a foothold in many Germanic nations.

"A Christian community that arose in 7th-century Syria, claiming its origins in St. Maro, a Syrian hermit of the late 4th and early 5th centuries. It is one of the largest Eastern-rite communities of the Roman Catholic Church, being particularly popular in modern Lebanon, and it is the only Eastern-rite church that has no non-Catholic or Orthodox counterpart. In 680 the Maronites were condemned for their supposed Monothelite beliefs: accepting the heretical doctrine of Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople, who stated that Christ had divine but no human will. The Maronites, however, assert that they have always been orthodox Christians. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was begun in 1182 and was further solidified in the 16th century with aid from the Jesuit community. After the pope, the spiritual head of the Maronites is the ""patriarch of Antioch and all the East,"" residing in Bkirki, near Beirut. Over the centuries and under various ruling bodies, the Maronites have managed to preserve their freedom, religion, and folk customs. The church retains the ancient West Syrian liturgy, even though Arabic is the vernacular language of the Maronites. Fearful of persecution, Maronites in the 19th century emigrated to southern Europe and North and South America where they can still be found today.","Maronite","95009"
